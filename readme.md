gridsim
=======

Fork of `gridsim` code from the publication of Sellman and Tsao et al. (2018).  

Sellman S, Tsao K, Tildesley MJ, Brommesson P, Webb CT, Wennergren U, et al. (2018) **Need for speed: An optimized gridding approach for spatially explicit disease simulations.** *PLoS Comput Biol* 14(4): e1006086. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006086

Original `readme.txt`:

> This is gridsim, a small kernel based spatially explicit livestock disease
> simulation. Gridsim is primarily intended to be a reference to the methods
> described in the main paper, and as an example of how to implement them. As
> such, it was never intended to be a disease simulation tool and the authors
> make no claims about its power as a predictive model. 
> 
> After compiling and assuming that the binary is called gridsim, run the
> program as "gridsim <config_file>" from the command line. Provided together
> with the code is an example config file which can be easily be modified to
> suit your needs. 
> If you want to use your own landscape file simply construct a text file with
> the columns [farm id, group, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, number of animal 
> species 1, number of animal species 2]. Each line is a node and the file should
> not contain a header. Group must be a number that indicates that the farm
> belongs to for instance a region such as a county or similar, although it is
> not necessary and every node can belong to the same group.
